- 👋 Hi, I’m @JuliAstaa - 🚀I'm a junior web developer
- 👀 I’m interested in web delevoper
- 👩‍💻 I am a junior web developer with an unusual background. Initially, I enrolled in multimedia, but ended up being placed in software engineering. In 2020, I entered Vocational High School amidst the pandemic and learned from home. My interest in programming arose while creating a website project about tourist attractions in Indonesia.
  After training at Politeknik Nasional, I learned PHP through YouTube and W3Schools. Within two months, I managed to create a simple CRUD website. In Grade 3 of Vocational High School, learning focused on PHP, Java, and C++, and I passed the Skills Compensation Test by creating a simple calculator and drugstore application.
  Although the economy stopped me from pursuing higher education, my dream of becoming a programmer was still alive. I continue to be self-taught at home and focus on React.js since July 2023. Currently, I am also trying Next.js. I am confident that my passion and skills will help me achieve my goal as a software developer.
